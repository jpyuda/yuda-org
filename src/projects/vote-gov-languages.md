Expanded Vote.gov from 2 languages to 20 languages, serving millions of voters in their preferred language while maintaining privacy-preserving design principles.

## Challenge

The 2020 election cycle revealed significant gaps in language access for voters. While the Voting Rights Act requires certain jurisdictions to provide language assistance, there was no centralized, privacy-respecting way for voters to access basic voting information in their preferred language.

## Approach

Started March 7, 2021 (the anniversary of Bloody Sunday), we developed a sustainable translation process that:

- Partnered with Department of Defense National Language Service Corps
- Established quality assurance processes for technical voting terminology
- Created content management workflows for 20+ languages
- Maintained Vote.gov's privacy-first architecture without tracking

## Impact

- Served millions of voters in languages including Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and others
- Reduced barriers to democratic participation for language minority communities
- Demonstrated feasibility of large-scale multilingual government services
- Influenced language access policies across federal agencies

## Technical Innovation

Unlike commercial translation services, we built this system without user tracking or data collection, proving that accessibility and privacy can coexist in government digital services.
