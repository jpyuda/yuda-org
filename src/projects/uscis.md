## Role

Lead product manager and designer (2014-2016) for myUSCIS digital transformation, leading the digital portions of DACA implementation and creating the first comprehensive suite of online immigration tools for USCIS.

## Challenge

U.S. immigration services operated through a maze of paper forms, contradictory instructions, and siloed processes that left millions struggling to navigate critical life decisions. The existing USCIS website was one of the most visited government sites (2.2 million weekly visitors) but provided no clear answers or guidance, forcing the public to rely on expensive immigration lawyers or unreliable third-party sources.

USCIS contact centers were overwhelmed with calls from people unable to find information or complete applications correctly, creating operational strain while leaving vulnerable populations without access to essential services.

## Approach

### Comprehensive Digital Service Design
Developed an integrated suite of online tools addressing the full immigration service journey:
- **"Answers"** - Natural language Q&A system providing authoritative responses to common immigration questions
- **"Explore My Options"** - Decision tree helping users identify appropriate visa categories and applications based on their specific circumstances
- **Digital form completion tools** - Streamlined application processes that eliminated redundant information collection across multiple forms

### Revolutionary Form Architecture
Created the first "form filler" approach for government services, deconstructing complex immigration applications into logical components. For DACA applications alone, this reduced 6 PDFs spanning 34 pages into a single, guided online experience with plain English instructions.

### Contact Center Relief Through Service Design
Addressed overwhelming call volume by improving upstream digital services rather than expanding contact center capacity. Better online information and tools reduced the need for human assistance while ensuring those who did need help could actually reach someone.

### Privacy-Preserving Implementation
Maintained client-side form completion that generated PDFs without data collection, proving that effective government services could operate without surveillance of vulnerable populations.

## Impact on Vulnerable Populations

### DACA Digital Implementation
Led the digital portions of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals implementation, serving a population particularly vulnerable to misinformation and predatory services. The online application tool provided authoritative guidance in plain English, helping ensure accurate submissions during a politically sensitive program launch.

### Multilingual Service Design
Designed services with language accessibility as a core requirement, understanding that immigration services inherently serve non-English speakers who face additional barriers in navigating complex government processes.

### Accessibility Innovation
Created form completion tools that worked for users with varying digital literacy levels while maintaining security and legal compliance requirements for immigration applications.

## Systems Impact

### Operational Efficiency
The person-centric approach reduced duplicative information collection across multiple immigration forms, improving accuracy while reducing administrative burden on both applicants and USCIS staff.

### Scalable Service Model
Established patterns for digital immigration services that could scale to serve millions while maintaining personalized guidance for individual circumstances.

### Cross-Agency Influence
The form modernization approach and person-centric design principles influenced digital service design across federal agencies, demonstrating how complex multi-form processes could be simplified through user-centered design.

## Research and Discovery

### Comprehensive User Research
Conducted extensive field research including visits to USCIS service centers, observing citizenship interviews, and interviewing immigrants throughout their application processes to understand real-world challenges and pain points.

### Stakeholder Integration
Worked closely with USCIS operations, legal teams, and policy staff to ensure digital services aligned with regulatory requirements while dramatically improving user experience.

### Iterative Development
Established continuous user testing and feedback cycles to refine services based on actual usage patterns rather than assumptions about how immigration processes should work.

## Long-term Influence

This work demonstrated that even the most complex government services could be redesigned around user needs rather than bureaucratic structure. The person-centric approach and form modernization techniques became templates for digital government transformation across agencies, proving that serving vulnerable populations well creates better services for everyone.
