Government has a unique opportunity to design digital systems that protect individual privacy while enabling efficient public services. Unlike private sector platforms that monetize personal data, government systems can be designed around data minimization and user control.

My work in this area focuses on building systems that use government data rather than private sector data for identity verification, reducing surveillance while maintaining security. This includes designing Vote.gov without tracking mechanisms, leading identity proofing platform development, and exploring information sharing systems that reduce redundant data collection.

The core challenge is balancing privacy with usability - making systems that protect people's information without creating barriers to accessing government services.
